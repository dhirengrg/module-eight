•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is the name of the client and wants to develop the secure web application that verify the file and ensure the secure communication for their plans of saving, retirements, investments, and insurance.

•	What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
To identify vulnerabilities the false positive of the project is the well found and it is important to secure the code because the vulnerabilities may be the gate to the attackers to obtain the sensitive information from the client’s database. Software security provides the overall wellbeing of the company because it secures the information and build the trust to their clients.

•	What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

To identify the more vulnerabilities from the report was the challenging for me.

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Using most secure algorithm cipher and finding the vulnerabilities increase the extra layer of the security of the client and in future I would assess more vulnerabilities and seek the secure solution possible.


•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
After testing and reviewing the vulnerabilities, I made certainty of the code was functional and review the previous vulnerabilities after the refactoring the code.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
SpringToolSuit, Maven Dependency, and command line were the right tools to practice the code and I would be using these tools in future as well. 

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Vulnerabilities reports and refectory code
